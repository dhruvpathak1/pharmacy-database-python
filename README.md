**Python Code & MySQL Code** files are the code used for python and database respectively.

## Project Introduction and understanding :-

We aimed to create a Pharmacy Management System using MySQL for the back-end database purposes and Python (Tkinter Module) for the front-end user interface.
The system has the following functionalities:
* The pharmacist uses this software to get the details and the reference of customers and hospitals which they provide services to.
* It is even used to keep a track of medical items such as medicines, sanitation items, etc.
* The status of all the medicines can be easily obtained through this software, i.e., if the medicine is in stock or not, the shelf number, whether it is in stock or not, if it is expired or not, etc. 
* It is used to keep a record of the purchased medicine and the respective amount.
* Further, the customer/hospital will be able to keep a track of their order and pay.
* The log-in section at the first will allow the customer/hospital to enter the pharmacy system and place its order. If an account doesnâ€™t exist, the system even allows to create a new account with all the detail.

The main problem in a Pharmacy Management System is to keep it updated. Due to the constant advancement in the medical field of the world, it is very difficult to keep the pharmacy management system up-to-date and to keep a track of every medicine available. It is a very tedious job to keep the system proper and error free and to keep the pharmacy working in an efficient and in an orderly manner. Medicines cures diseases and illnesses and hence are very important to be updated every now and then. Expiration dates create an issue as well since the pharmacy needs to be careful while distributing medicines in large numbers.
